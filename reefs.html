Together, they form the largest living structure on Earth. Few people outside of Australia know that the forests and woodlands that trace the northern Queensland coastline are a global deforestation hotspot. Nearly a decade of lax regulations allowed landowners to clear trees at a breakneck pace to make way for cattle and crops." second-paragraph="" %}
